Description: The HOIFCar package is designed for estimating treatment effects using various covariate adjustment methods.
    It provides point estimates of treatment effects in the treatment arm, along with oracle bias, variance, and the 
    corresponding approximated variance for the adjusted estimators motivated by higher-order influence functions (HOIF). 
    Details of the methodology can be found in Zhao, S., Wang, X., Liu, L., and Zhang, X. (2024), 
    "Covariate Adjustment in Randomized Experiments Motivated by Higher-Order Influence Functions."
