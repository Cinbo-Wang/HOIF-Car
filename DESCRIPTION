Description: The HOIFCar package facilitates the estimation of treatment effects through a range of covariate adjustment methods. It supports the calculation of point estimates and variance estimates for treatment effects within the treatment arm. Additionally, the package provides oracle bias, oracle variance, and the corresponding approximated variance for adjusted estimators derived from higher-order influence functions (HOIF).
    Details of the methodology can be found in Zhao, S., Wang, X., Liu, L., and Zhang, X. (2024),  "Covariate Adjustment in Randomized Experiments Motivated by Higher-Order Influence Functions."
